Initial repository for learning how to use github

This is my first repository on github.  I have a computer engineering degree from Cal Poly, SLO, but my career path has been leading more down a quality assurance role. I'm looking forward to getting back into coding and make use of my degree.  Testing is fun and has its merits, but I'd rather be the one creating things.
